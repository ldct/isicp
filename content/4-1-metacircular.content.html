<h2> The Metacircular Evaluator </h2>

<p> Our evaluator for Lisp will be implemented as a Lisp program. It may seem circular to think about evaluating Lisp programs using an evaluator that is itself implemented in Lisp. However, evaluation is a process, so it is appropriate to describe the evaluation process using Lisp, which, after all, is our tool for describing processes.<a name="footnote_link_1-3" class="footnote_link" href="#footnote_1-3">3</a> An evaluator that is written in the same language that it evaluates is said to be <tt>metacircular</tt>  .
The metacircular evaluator is essentially a Scheme formulation of the
environment model of evaluation described in section <a href="3-2-environment.html">3.2</a>. Recall that
the model has two basic parts:

<ul>
<li>
<p> To evaluate a combination (a compound expression other than a special form), evaluate the subexpressions and then apply the value of the operator subexpression to the values of the operand subexpressions.
</li>

<li>
<p> To apply a compound procedure to a set of arguments, evaluate the body of the procedure in a new environment. To construct this environment, extend the environment part of the procedure object by a frame in which the formal parameters of the procedure are bound to the arguments to which the procedure is applied.
</li>
</ul>

<p> These two rules describe the essence of the evaluation process, a basic cycle in which expressions to be evaluated in environments are reduced to procedures to be applied to arguments, which in turn are reduced to new expressions to be evaluated in new environments, and so on, until we get down to symbols, whose values are looked up in the environment, and to primitive procedures, which are applied directly (see Figure 4-1).<a name="footnote_link_1-4" class="footnote_link" href="#footnote_1-4">4</a> This evaluation cycle will be embodied by the interplay between the two critical procedures in the evaluator, <tt>eval</tt> and <tt>apply</tt>, which are
described in section <a href="4-1-metacircular.html">4.1.1</a> (see Figure 4-1).

<p> The implementation of the evaluator will depend upon procedures that define the <em>syntax</em> of the expressions to be evaluated. We will use data abstraction to make the evaluator independent of the representation of the language. For example, rather than committing to a choice that an assignment is to be represented by a list beginning with the symbol <tt>set!</tt> we use an abstract predicate <tt>assignment?</tt> to test for an assignment, and we use abstract selectors <tt>assignment-variable</tt> and <tt>assignment-value</tt> to access the parts of an assignment. Implementation of expressions will be described in detail in section <a href="4-1-metacircular.html">4.1.2</a>. There are also operations, described in section <a href="4-1-metacircular.html">4.1.3</a>, that specify the representation of procedures and environments. For example, <tt>make-procedure</tt> constructs compound procedures, <tt>lookup-variable-value</tt> accesses the values of variables, and <tt>apply-primitive-procedure</tt> applies a primitive procedure to a given list of arguments.

<h3> 4.1.1 The Core of the Evaluator </h3>

<p> <img class='center' src='images/ch4-Z-G-1.gif'>

<p style="text-align:center"> <b>Figure 4.1:</b> The <tt>eval</tt>-<tt>apply</tt> cycle
exposes the essence of a computer language.

<p> The evaluation process can be described as the interplay between two procedures: <tt>eval</tt> and <tt>apply</tt>.

<h4> Eval </h4>

<p> <tt>Eval</tt> takes as arguments an expression and an environment. It classifies the expression and directs its evaluation. <tt>Eval</tt> is structured as a case analysis of the syntactic type of the expression to be evaluated. In order to keep the procedure general, we express the determination of the type of an expression abstractly, making no commitment to any particular representation for the various types of expressions. Each type of expression has a predicate that tests for it and an abstract means for selecting its parts. This <tt>abstract syntax</tt> makes it easy to see how we can change the syntax of the language by using the same evaluator, but with a different collection of syntax procedures.


<h5> Primitive expressions </h5>

<ul>
<li>
<p> For self-evaluating expressions, such as numbers, <tt>eval</tt> returns the expression itself.
</li>

<li>
<p> <tt>Eval</tt> must look up variables in the environment to find their values.
</li>
</ul>


<h5> Special forms </h5>

<ul>
<li>
For quoted expressions, <tt>eval</tt> returns the expression that was quoted.
</li>

<li>
An assignment to (or a definition of) a variable must recursively call <tt>eval</tt> to compute the new value to be associated with the variable. The environment must be modified to change (or create) the binding of the variable.
</li>

<li>
<p> An <tt>if</tt> expression requires special processing of its parts, so as to evaluate the consequent if the predicate is true, and otherwise to evaluate the alternative.
</li>

<li>
<p> A <tt>lambda</tt> expression must be transformed into an applicable procedure by packaging together the parameters and body specified by the <tt>lambda</tt> expression with the environment of the evaluation.
</li>

<li>
<p> A <tt>begin</tt> expression requires evaluating its sequence of expressions in the order in which they appear.
</li>

<li>
<p> A case analysis (<tt>cond</tt>) is transformed into a nest of <tt>if</tt> expressions and then evaluated.
</li>
</ul>


<h5> Combinations </h5>

<ul>
<li>
<p> For a procedure application, <tt>eval</tt> must recursively evaluate the operator part and the operands of the combination. The resulting procedure and arguments are passed to <tt>apply</tt>, which handles the actual procedure application.
</li>
</ul>

<p> Here is the definition of <tt>eval</tt>:

<div id="scheme-eval">
(define (eval exp env)
  (cond ((self-evaluating? exp) exp)
        ((variable? exp) (lookup-variable-value exp env))
        ((quoted? exp) (text-of-quotation exp))
        ((assignment? exp) (eval-assignment exp env))
        ((definition? exp) (eval-definition exp env))
        ((if? exp) (eval-if exp env))
        ((lambda? exp)
         (make-procedure (lambda-parameters exp)
                         (lambda-body exp)
                         env))
        ((begin? exp)
         (eval-sequence (begin-actions exp) env))
        ((cond? exp) (eval (cond->if exp) env))
        ((application? exp)
         (apply (eval (operator exp) env)
                (list-of-values (operands exp) env)))
        (else
         (error "Unknown expression type -- EVAL" exp))))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-eval", ["scheme-apply"]);
</script>

<p> For clarity, <tt>eval</tt> has been implemented as a case analysis using <tt>cond</tt>. The disadvantage of this is that our procedure handles only a few distinguishable types of expressions, and no new ones can be defined without editing the definition of <tt>eval</tt>. In most Lisp implementations, dispatching on the type of an expression is done in a data-directed style. This allows a user to add new types of expressions that <tt>eval</tt> can distinguish, without modifying the definition of <tt>eval</tt> itself. (See Exercise 4-3.)

<h4> Apply </h4>

<p> <tt>Apply</tt> takes two arguments, a procedure and a list of arguments to which the procedure should be applied. <tt>Apply</tt> classifies procedures into two kinds: It calls <tt>apply-primitive-procedure</tt> to apply primitives; it applies compound procedures by sequentially evaluating the expressions that make up the body of the procedure. The environment for the evaluation of the body of a compound procedure is constructed by extending the base environment carried by the procedure to include a frame that binds the parameters of the procedure to the arguments to which the procedure is to be applied. Here is the definition of <tt>apply</tt>:

<div id="scheme-apply">
(define (apply procedure arguments)
  (cond ((primitive-procedure? procedure)
         (apply-primitive-procedure procedure arguments))
        ((compound-procedure? procedure)
         (eval-sequence
           (procedure-body procedure)
           (extend-environment
             (procedure-parameters procedure)
             arguments
             (procedure-environment procedure))))
        (else
         (error
          "Unknown procedure type -- APPLY" procedure))))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-apply", ["scheme-eval"]);
</script>

<h4> Procedure arguments </h4>

<p> When <tt>eval</tt> processes a procedure application, it uses <tt>list-of-values</tt> to produce the list of arguments to which the procedure is to be applied. <tt>List-of-values</tt> takes as an argument the operands of the combination. It evaluates each operand and returns a list of the corresponding values:<a name="footnote_link_1-5" class="footnote_link" href="#footnote_1-5">5</a>

<div id="scheme-list-of-values">
(define (list-of-values exps env)
  (if (no-operands? exps)
      '()
      (cons (eval (first-operand exps) env)
            (list-of-values (rest-operands exps) env))))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-list-of-values");
</script>


<h4> Conditionals </h4>

<p> <tt>Eval-if</tt> evaluates the predicate part of an <tt>if</tt> expression in the given environment. If the result is true, <tt>eval-if</tt> evaluates the consequent, otherwise it evaluates the alternative:

<div id="scheme-eval-if">
(define (eval-if exp env)
  (if (true? (eval (if-predicate exp) env))
      (eval (if-consequent exp) env)
      (eval (if-alternative exp) env)))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-eval-if");
</script>

<p> The use of <tt>true?</tt> in <tt>eval-if</tt> highlights the issue of the connection between an implemented language and an implementation language. The <tt>if-predicate</tt> is evaluated in the language being implemented and thus yields a value in that language. The interpreter predicate <tt>true?</tt> translates that value into a value that can be tested by the <tt>if</tt> in the implementation language: The metacircular representation of truth might not be the same as that of the underlying Scheme.<a name="footnote_link_1-6" class="footnote_link" href="#footnote_1-6">6</a>

<h4> Sequences </h4>

<p> <tt>Eval-sequence</tt> is used by <tt>apply</tt> to evaluate the sequence of expressions in a procedure body and by <tt>eval</tt> to evaluate the sequence of expressions in a <tt>begin</tt> expression. It takes as arguments a sequence of expressions and an environment, and evaluates the expressions in the order in which they occur. The value returned is the value of the final expression.

<div id="scheme-eval-sequence">
(define (eval-sequence exps env)
  (cond ((last-exp? exps) (eval (first-exp exps) env))
        (else (eval (first-exp exps) env)
              (eval-sequence (rest-exps exps) env))))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-eval-sequence");
</script>

<h4> Assignments and definitions </h4>

<p> The following procedure handles assignments to variables. It calls <tt>eval</tt> to find the value to be assigned and transmits the variable and the resulting value to <tt>set-variable-value!</tt> to be installed in the designated environment.

<div id="scheme-eval-assignment">
(define (eval-assignment exp env)
  (set-variable-value! (assignment-variable exp)
                       (eval (assignment-value exp) env)
                       env)
  'ok)
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-eval-assignment");
</script>


<p> Definitions of variables are handled in a similar manner.<a name="footnote_link_1-7" class="footnote_link" href="#footnote_1-7">7</a>

<div id="scheme-eval-definition">
(define (eval-definition exp env)
  (define-variable! (definition-variable exp)
                    (eval (definition-value exp) env)
                    env)
  'ok)
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-eval-definition");
</script>

<p> We have chosen here to return the symbol <tt>ok</tt> as the value of an
assignment or a definition.<a name="footnote_link_1-8" class="footnote_link" href="#footnote_1-8">8</a>

<div class="exercise">
<p> <b>Exercise 4.1:</b> Notice that we cannot tell whether the metacircular evaluator evaluates operands from left to right or from right to left. Its evaluation order is inherited from the underlying Lisp: If the arguments to <tt>cons</tt> in <tt>list-of-values</tt> are evaluated from left to right, then <tt>list-of-values</tt> will evaluate operands from left to right; and if the arguments to <tt>cons</tt> are evaluated from right to left, then <tt>list-of-values</tt> will evaluate operands from right to left.

Write a version of <tt>list-of-values</tt> that evaluates operands from left to right regardless of the order of evaluation in the underlying Lisp. Also write a version of <tt>list-of-values</tt> that evaluates operands from right to left.
</div>

<h3> 4.1.2 Representing Expressions </h3>

<p> The evaluator is reminiscent of the symbolic differentiation program discussed in section <a href="2-3-symbolic.html">2.3.2</a>. Both programs operate on symbolic expressions. Inboth programs, the result of operating on a compound expression is determinedby operating recursively on the pieces of the expression and combining theresults in a way that depends on the type of the expression. In both programswe used data abstraction to decouple the general rules of operation from thedetails of how expressions are represented. In the differentiation programthis meant that the same differentiation procedure could deal with algebraicexpressions in prefix form, in infix form, or in some other form. For theevaluator, this means that the syntax of the language being evaluated isdetermined solely by the procedures that classify and extract pieces of expressions.

<p> Here is the specification of the syntax of our language:

<ul>

<li>
<p> The only self-evaluating items are numbers and strings:

<div id="scheme-self-evaluating-p">
(define (self-evaluating? exp)
  (cond ((number? exp) true)
        ((string? exp) true)
        (else false)))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-self-evaluating-p");
</script>

<li>
<p> Variables are represented by symbols:

<div id="scheme-variable-p">
(define (variable? exp) (symbol? exp))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-variable-p");
</script>

<li>
<p> Quotations have the form <tt>(quote &lt;text-of-quotation&gt;)</tt>:<a name="footnote_link_1-9" class="footnote_link" href="#footnote_1-9">9</a>

<div id="scheme-quoted-p">
(define (quoted? exp)
  (tagged-list? exp 'quote))

(define (text-of-quotation exp) (cadr exp))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-quoted-p");
</script>

<p> <tt>Quoted?</tt> is defined in terms of the procedure <tt>tagged-list?</tt>, which identifies lists beginning with a designated symbol:

<div id="scheme-tagged-list-p">
(define (tagged-list? exp tag)
  (if (pair? exp)
      (eq? (car exp) tag)
      false))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-tagged-list-p");
</script>

<li>
<p> Assignments have the form <tt>(set! ⟨var⟩ ⟨value⟩)</tt>:

<div id="scheme-define-assignment">
(define (assignment? exp)
  (tagged-list? exp 'set!))

(define (assignment-variable exp) (cadr exp))

(define (assignment-value exp) (caddr exp))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-define-assignment");
</script>

<li>
<p> Definitions have the form

<div id="scheme-definition-form">
(define ⟨var⟩ ⟨value⟩)
</div>
<script>
C.no_output_frozen_prompt("scheme-definition-form");
</script>

<p> or the form

<div id="scheme-define-form">
(define (⟨var⟩ ⟨parameter_1⟩ ... ⟨parameter_n⟩)
  ⟨body⟩)
</div>
<script>
C.no_output_frozen_prompt("scheme-define-form");
</script>

<p> The latter form (standard procedure definition) is syntactic sugar for

<div id="scheme-define-form-expanded">
(define ⟨var⟩
  (lambda (⟨parameter_1⟩ ... ⟨parameter_n⟩)
    ⟨body⟩))
</div>
<script>
C.no_output_frozen_prompt("scheme-define-form-expanded");
</script>

<p> The corresponding syntax procedures are the following:

<div id="scheme-definition-p">
(define (definition? exp)
  (tagged-list? exp 'define))

(define (definition-variable exp)
  (if (symbol? (cadr exp))
      (cadr exp)
      (caadr exp)))

(define (definition-value exp)
  (if (symbol? (cadr exp))
      (caddr exp)
      (make-lambda (cdadr exp)   ; formal parameters
                   (cddr exp)))) ; body
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-definition-p");
</script>

<li>
<p> <tt>Lambda</tt> expressions are lists that begin with the symbol <tt>lambda</tt>:

<div id="scheme-define-lambda-p">
(define (lambda? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'lambda))

(define (lambda-parameters exp) (cadr exp))

(define (lambda-body exp) (cddr exp))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-define-lambda-p");
</script>

<p> We also provide a constructor for <tt>lambda</tt> expressions, which is used by <tt>definition-value</tt>, above:

<div id="scheme-define-make-lambda">
(define (make-lambda parameters body)
  (cons 'lambda (cons parameters body)))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-define-make-lambda");
</script>

<li>
<p> Conditionals begin with <tt>if</tt> and have a predicate, a consequent, and an (optional) alternative. If the expression has no alternative part, we provide <tt>false</tt> as the alternative.<a name="footnote_link_1-10" class="footnote_link" href="#footnote_1-10">10</a>

<div id="scheme-define-if-p">
(define (if? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'if))

(define (if-predicate exp) (cadr exp))

(define (if-consequent exp) (caddr exp))

(define (if-alternative exp)
  (if (not (null? (cdddr exp)))
      (cadddr exp)
      'false))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-define-if-p");
</script>

<p> We also provide a constructor for <tt>if</tt> expressions, to be used by <tt>cond->if</tt> to transform <tt>cond</tt> expressions into <tt>if</tt> expressions:

<div id="scheme-define-make-if">
(define (make-if predicate consequent alternative)
  (list 'if predicate consequent alternative))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-define-make-if");
</script>

<li>
<p> <tt>Begin</tt> packages a sequence of expressions into a single expression. We include syntax operations on <tt>begin</tt> expressions to extract the actual sequence from the <tt>begin</tt> expression, as well as selectors that return the first expression and the rest of the expressions in the sequence.<a name="footnote_link_1-11" class="footnote_link" href="#footnote_1-11">11</a>

<div id="scheme-define-begin-p">
(define (begin? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'begin))

(define (begin-actions exp) (cdr exp))

(define (last-exp? seq) (null? (cdr seq)))

(define (first-exp seq) (car seq))

(define (rest-exps seq) (cdr seq))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-define-begin-p");
</script>

<p> We also include a constructor <tt>sequence->exp</tt> (for use by <tt>cond->if</tt>) that transforms a sequence into a single expression, using <tt>begin</tt> if necessary:

<div id="scheme-define-sequence-exp">
(define (sequence->exp seq)
  (cond ((null? seq) seq)
        ((last-exp? seq) (first-exp seq))
        (else (make-begin seq))))

(define (make-begin seq) (cons 'begin seq))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-define-sequence-exp");
</script>

<li>
<p> A procedure application is any compound expression that is not one of the above expression types. The <tt>car</tt> of the expression is the operator, and the <tt>cdr</tt> is the list of operands:

<div id="scheme-define-application-p">
(define (application? exp) (pair? exp))

(define (operator exp) (car exp))

(define (operands exp) (cdr exp))

(define (no-operands? ops) (null? ops))

(define (first-operand ops) (car ops))

(define (rest-operands ops) (cdr ops))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-define-application-p");
</script>

</ul>

<h4> Derived expressions </h4>

<p> Some special forms in our language can be defined in terms of expressions involving other special forms, rather than being implemented directly. One example is <tt>cond</tt>, which can be implemented as a nest of <tt>if</tt> expressions. For example, we can reduce the problem of evaluating the expression

<div id="scheme-ex-cond-pre-desugar">
(cond ((> x 0) x)
      ((= x 0) (display 'zero) 0)
      (else (- x)))
</div>
<script>
C.no_output_frozen_prompt("scheme-ex-cond-pre-desugar");
</script>

<p> to the problem of evaluating the following expression involving <tt>if</tt> and <tt>begin</tt> expressions:

<div id="scheme-ex-cond-post-desugar">
(if (> x 0)
    x
    (if (= x 0)
        (begin (display 'zero)
               0)
        (- x)))
</div>
<script>
C.no_output_frozen_prompt("scheme-ex-cond-post-desugar");
</script>

<p> Implementing the evaluation of <tt>cond</tt> in this way simplifies the evaluator because it reduces the number of special forms for which the evaluation process must be explicitly specified.

<p> We include syntax procedures that extract the parts of a <tt>cond</tt> expression, and a procedure <tt>cond->if</tt> that transforms <tt>cond</tt> expressions into <tt>if</tt> expressions. A case analysis begins with <tt>cond</tt> and has a list of predicate-action clauses. A clause is an <tt>else</tt> clause if its predicate is the symbol <tt>else</tt>.<a name="footnote_link_1-12" class="footnote_link" href="#footnote_1-12">12</a>

<div id="scheme-define-cond-p">
(define (cond? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'cond))

(define (cond-clauses exp) (cdr exp))

(define (cond-else-clause? clause)
  (eq? (cond-predicate clause) 'else))

(define (cond-predicate clause) (car clause))

(define (cond-actions clause) (cdr clause))

(define (cond->if exp)
  (expand-clauses (cond-clauses exp)))

(define (expand-clauses clauses)
  (if (null? clauses)
      'false                          ; no <tt>else</tt> clause
      (let ((first (car clauses))
            (rest (cdr clauses)))
        (if (cond-else-clause? first)
            (if (null? rest)
                (sequence->exp (cond-actions first))
                (error "ELSE clause isn't last -- COND->IF"
                       clauses))
            (make-if (cond-predicate first)
                     (sequence->exp (cond-actions first))
                     (expand-clauses rest))))))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-define-cond-p");
</script>

<p> Expressions (such as <tt>cond</tt>) that we choose to implement as syntactic transformations are called <tt>derived expressions</tt>. <tt>Let</tt> expressions are also derived expressions (see Exercise 4-6).<a name="footnote_link_1-13" class="footnote_link" href="#footnote_1-13">4</a>

<div class="exercise">
<p> <b>Exercise 4.2:</b> Louis Reasoner plans to reorder the <tt>cond</tt> clauses in <tt>eval</tt> so that the clause for procedure applications appears before the clause for assignments. He argues that this will make the interpreter more efficient: Since programs usually contain more applications than assignments, definitions, and so on, his modified <tt>eval</tt> will usually check fewer clauses than the original <tt>eval</tt> before identifying the type of an expression.

<ul>
<li>
<p> What is wrong with Louis's plan?  (Hint: What will Louis's evaluator do with the expression <tt>(define x 3)</tt>?)

<li>
<p> Louis is upset that his plan didn't work. He is willing to go to any lengths to make his evaluator recognize procedure applications before it checks for most other kinds of expressions. Help him by changing the syntax of the evaluated language so that procedure applications start with <tt>call</tt>. For example, instead of <tt>(factorial 3)</tt> we will now have to write <tt>(call factorial 3)</tt> and instead of <tt>(+ 1 2)</tt> we will have to write <tt>(call + 1 2)</tt>.

</ul>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<p> <b>Exercise 4.3:</b> Rewrite <tt>eval</tt> so that the dispatch is done in data-directed style. Compare this with the data-directed differentiation procedure of Exercise 2-73.

<h3> 4.1.3 Evaluator Data Structures </h3>

<p> In addition to defining the external syntax of expressions, the evaluator implementation must also define the data structures that the evaluator manipulates internally, as part of the execution of a program, such as the representation of procedures and environments and the representation of true and false.

<h4> Testing of predicates </h4>

<p> For conditionals, we accept anything to be true that is not the explicit <tt>false</tt> object.

<div id="">
(define (true? x)
  (not (eq? x false)))

(define (false? x)
  (eq? x false))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<h4> Representing procedures </h4>

<p> To handle primitives, we assume that we have available the following procedures:

<ul>

<li>
<tt>(apply-primitive-procedure proc args)}


applies the given primitive procedure to the argument values in the list
<args> and returns the result of the application.

<li>
<tt>(primitive-procedure? proc)


<p> tests whether <proc> is a primitive procedure.

</ul>

<p> These mechanisms for handling primitives are further described in section
4-1-4.

<p> Compound procedures are constructed from parameters, procedure bodies, and
environments using the constructor <tt>make-procedure</tt>:

<div id="">
(define (make-procedure parameters body env)
  (list 'procedure parameters body env))

(define (compound-procedure? p)
  (tagged-list? p 'procedure))

(define (procedure-parameters p) (cadr p))

(define (procedure-body p) (caddr p))

(define (procedure-environment p) (cadddr p))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<h4> Operations on Environments </h4>

<p> The evaluator needs operations for manipulating environments. As explained in
section <a href="3-2-environment.html">3.2</a>, an environment is a sequence of frames, where each frame is
a table of bindings that associate variables with their corresponding values.
We use the following operations for manipulating environments:

<ul>

<li>
<tt>(lookup-variable-value var env)}

returns the value that is bound to the symbol <var> in the environment
<env>, or signals an error if the variable is unbound.

<li>
<tt>(extend-environment variables values base-env)}

<p> returns a new environment, consisting of a new frame in which the symbols in
the list <variables> are bound to the corresponding elements in the list
<values>, where the enclosing environment is the environment
<base-env>.

<li>
<tt>(define-variable! var value env)}

adds to the first frame in the environment <env> a new binding that
associates the variable <var> with the value <value>.

<li>
<tt>(set-variable-value! var value env)}

changes the binding of the variable <var> in the environment <env>
so that the variable is now bound to the value <value>, or signals an
error if the variable is unbound.

</ul>

<p> To implement these operations we represent an environment as a list of frames.
The enclosing environment of an environment is the <tt>cdr</tt> of the list. The
empty environment is simply the empty list.

<div id="">
(define (enclosing-environment env) (cdr env))

(define (first-frame env) (car env))

(define the-empty-environment '())
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> Each frame of an environment is represented as a pair of lists: a list of the
variables bound in that frame and a list of the associated
values.<a name="footnote_link_1-14" class="footnote_link" href="#footnote_1-14">14</a>

<div id="">
(define (make-frame variables values)
  (cons variables values))

(define (frame-variables frame) (car frame))

(define (frame-values frame) (cdr frame))

(define (add-binding-to-frame! var val frame)
  (set-car! frame (cons var (car frame)))
  (set-cdr! frame (cons val (cdr frame))))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> To extend an environment by a new frame that associates variables with values,
we make a frame consisting of the list of variables and the list of values, and
we adjoin this to the environment. We signal an error if the number of
variables does not match the number of values.

<div id="">
(define (extend-environment vars vals base-env)
  (if (= (length vars) (length vals))
      (cons (make-frame vars vals) base-env)
      (if (< (length vars) (length vals))
          (error "Too many arguments supplied" vars vals)
          (error "Too few arguments supplied" vars vals))))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> To look up a variable in an environment, we scan the list of variables in the
first frame. If we find the desired variable, we return the corresponding
element in the list of values. If we do not find the variable in the current
frame, we search the enclosing environment, and so on. If we reach the empty
environment, we signal an ``unbound variable'' error.

<div id="">
(define (lookup-variable-value var env)
  (define (env-loop env)
    (define (scan vars vals)
      (cond ((null? vars)
             (env-loop (enclosing-environment env)))
            ((eq? var (car vars))
             (car vals))
            (else (scan (cdr vars) (cdr vals)))))
    (if (eq? env the-empty-environment)
        (error "Unbound variable" var)
        (let ((frame (first-frame env)))
          (scan (frame-variables frame)
                (frame-values frame)))))
  (env-loop env))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> To set a variable to a new value in a specified environment, we scan for the
variable, just as in <tt>lookup-variable-value</tt>, and change the corresponding
value when we find it.

<div id="">
(define (set-variable-value! var val env)
  (define (env-loop env)
    (define (scan vars vals)
      (cond ((null? vars)
             (env-loop (enclosing-environment env)))
            ((eq? var (car vars))
             (set-car! vals val))
            (else (scan (cdr vars) (cdr vals)))))
    (if (eq? env the-empty-environment)
        (error "Unbound variable -- SET!" var)
        (let ((frame (first-frame env)))
          (scan (frame-variables frame)
                (frame-values frame)))))
  (env-loop env))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> To define a variable, we search the first frame for a binding for the variable,
and change the binding if it exists (just as in <tt>set-variable-value!</tt>).
If no such binding exists, we adjoin one to the first frame.

<div id="">
(define (define-variable! var val env)
  (let ((frame (first-frame env)))
    (define (scan vars vals)
      (cond ((null? vars)
             (add-binding-to-frame! var val frame))
            ((eq? var (car vars))
             (set-car! vals val))
            (else (scan (cdr vars) (cdr vals)))))
    (scan (frame-variables frame)
          (frame-values frame))))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> The method described here is only one of many plausible ways to represent environments. Since we used data abstraction to isolate the rest of the evaluator from the detailed choice of representation, we could change the environment representation if we wanted to. (See Exercise 4-11.)  In a production-quality Lisp system, the speed of the evaluator's environment operations---especially that of variable lookup---has a major impact on the performance of the system. The representation described here, although conceptually simple, is not efficient and would not ordinarily be used in a production system.<a name="footnote_link_1-15" class="footnote_link" href="#footnote_1-15">15</a>

<div class="exercise">
<p> <b>Exercise 4.11:</b> Instead of representing a frame
as a pair of lists, we can represent a frame as a list of bindings, where each
binding is a name-value pair. Rewrite the environment operations to use this
alternative representation.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<p> <b>Exercise 4.12:</b> The procedures
<tt>set-variable-value!</tt>, <tt>define-variable!</tt>, and
<tt>lookup-variable-value</tt> can be expressed in terms of more abstract

capture the common patterns and redefine the three procedures in terms of these
abstractions.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<p> <b>Exercise 4.13:</b> Scheme allows us to create new
bindings for variables by means of <tt>define</tt>, but provides no way to get
rid of bindings. Implement for the evaluator a special form
<tt>make-unbound!</tt> that removes the binding of a given symbol from the
environment in which the <tt>make-unbound!</tt> expression is evaluated. This
problem is not completely specified. For example, should we remove only the
binding in the first frame of the environment?  Complete the specification and
justify any choices you make.

<h3> 4.1.4 Running the Evaluator as a Program </h3>

<p> Given the evaluator, we have in our hands a description (expressed in Lisp) of
the process by which Lisp expressions are evaluated. One advantage of
expressing the evaluator as a program is that we can run the program. This
gives us, running within Lisp, a working model of how Lisp itself evaluates
expressions. This can serve as a framework for experimenting with evaluation
rules, as we shall do later in this chapter.

<p> Our evaluator program reduces expressions ultimately to the application of
primitive procedures. Therefore, all that we need to run the evaluator is to
create a mechanism that calls on the underlying Lisp system to model the
application of primitive procedures.

<p> There must be a binding for each primitive procedure name, so that when
<tt>eval</tt> evaluates the operator of an application of a primitive, it will
find an object to pass to <tt>apply</tt>. We thus set up a global environment
that associates unique objects with the names of the primitive procedures that
can appear in the expressions we will be evaluating. The global environment
also includes bindings for the symbols <tt>true</tt> and <tt>false</tt>, so that
they can be used as variables in expressions to be evaluated.

<div id="">
(define (setup-environment)
  (let ((initial-env
         (extend-environment (primitive-procedure-names)
                             (primitive-procedure-objects)
                             the-empty-environment)))
    (define-variable! 'true true initial-env)
    (define-variable! 'false false initial-env)
    initial-env))

(define the-global-environment (setup-environment))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> It does not matter how we represent the primitive procedure objects, so long as
<tt>apply</tt> can identify and apply them by using the procedures
<tt>primitive-procedure?</tt> and <tt>apply-primitive-procedure</tt>. We have
chosen to represent a primitive procedure as a list beginning with the symbol
<tt>primitive</tt> and containing a procedure in the underlying Lisp that
implements that primitive.

<div id="">
(define (primitive-procedure? proc)
  (tagged-list? proc 'primitive))

(define (primitive-implementation proc) (cadr proc))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();

<p> <tt>Setup-environment</tt> will get the primitive names and implementation
procedures from a list:<a name="footnote_link_1-16" class="footnote_link" href="#footnote_1-16">16</a>

<p> For convenience in running the metacircular evaluator, we provide a
<tt>driver loop</tt>
 that models the read-eval-print loop of the underlying
Lisp system. It prints a <tt>prompt</tt>
, reads an input expression,
evaluates this expression in the global environment, and prints the result. We
precede each printed result by an <tt>output prompt</tt>
 so as to distinguish
the value of the expression from other output that may be printed.<a name="footnote_link_1-18" class="footnote_link" href="#footnote_1-18">18</a>

<div id="">
(define input-prompt ";;; M-Eval input:")

<script>

<p> We use a special printing procedure, <tt>user-print</tt>, to avoid printing the
environment part of a compound procedure, which may be a very long list (or may
even contain cycles).

<div id="">
(define (user-print object)
  (if (compound-procedure? object)
      (display (list 'compound-procedure
                     (procedure-parameters object)
                     (procedure-body object)
                     '<procedure-env>))
      (display object)))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> Now all we need to do to run the evaluator is to initialize the global
environment and start the driver loop. Here is a sample interaction:

<h3> 4.1.5 Data as Programs </h3>

<p> In thinking about a Lisp program that evaluates Lisp expressions, an analogy
might be helpful. One operational view of the meaning of a program is that a
program is a description of an abstract (perhaps infinitely large) machine.
For example, consider the familiar program to compute factorials:

<div id="">
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 1)
      1
      (* (factorial (- n 1)) n)))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> We may regard this program as the description of a machine containing parts
that decrement, multiply, and test for equality, together with a two-position
switch and another factorial machine. (The factorial machine is infinite
because it contains another factorial machine within it.)  Figure 4-2 is
a flow diagram for the factorial machine, showing how the parts are wired
together.

<b>Figure 4.2:</b> The factorial program, viewed as an

</div>

<p> In a similar way, we can regard the evaluator as a very special machine that
takes as input a description of a machine. Given this input, the evaluator
configures itself to emulate the machine described. For example, if we feed
our evaluator the definition of <tt>factorial</tt>, as shown in Figure 4-3,
the evaluator will be able to compute factorials.

<div class="exercise">
<b>Figure 4.3:</b> The evaluator emulating a factorial
machine.

<pre>
</pre>
</div>

<p> From this perspective, our evaluator is seen to be a <tt>universal
machine</tt>
. It mimics other machines when these are described as Lisp
programs.@footnote{The fact that the machines are described in Lisp is
inessential. If we give our evaluator a Lisp program that behaves as an
evaluator for some other language, say C, the Lisp evaluator will emulate the C
evaluator, which in turn can emulate any machine described as a C program.
Similarly, writing a Lisp evaluator in C produces a C program that can execute
any Lisp program. The deep idea here is that any evaluator can emulate any
other. Thus, the notion of ``what can in principle be computed'' (ignoring
practicalities of time and memory required) is independent of the language or
the computer, and instead reflects an underlying notion of
<tt>computability</tt>
. This was first demonstrated in a clear way by Alan
M. Turing (1912-1954), whose 1936 paper laid the foundations for theoretical
computer science. In the paper, Turing presented a simple computational
model---now known as a <tt>Turing machine</tt>
---and argued that any
``effective process'' can be formulated as a program for such a machine. (This
argument is known as the <tt>Church-Turing thesis</tt>
.)  Turing then
implemented a universal machine, i.e., a Turing machine that behaves as an
evaluator for Turing-machine programs. He used this framework to demonstrate
that there are well-posed problems that cannot be computed by Turing machines
(see Exercise 4-15), and so by implication cannot be formulated as
``effective processes.''  Turing went on to make fundamental contributions to
practical computer science as well. For example, he invented the idea of
structuring programs using general-purpose subroutines. See Hodges 1983 for a
biography of Turing.} This is striking. Try to imagine an analogous evaluator
for electrical circuits. This would be a circuit that takes as input a signal
encoding the plans for some other circuit, such as a filter. Given this input,
the circuit evaluator would then behave like a filter with the same
description. Such a universal electrical circuit is almost unimaginably
complex. It is remarkable that the program evaluator is a rather simple
program.@footnote{Some people find it counterintuitive that an evaluator, which
is implemented by a relatively simple procedure, can emulate programs that are
more complex than the evaluator itself. The existence of a universal evaluator
machine is a deep and wonderful property of computation. <tt>Recursion
theory</tt>
, a branch of mathematical logic, is concerned with logical limits of
computation. Douglas Hofstadter's beautiful book @cite{G@"odel, Escher, Bach}
(1979) explores some of these ideas.}

Another striking aspect of the evaluator is that it acts as a bridge between
the data objects that are manipulated by our programming language and the
programming language itself. Imagine that the evaluator program (implemented
in Lisp) is running, and that a user is typing expressions to the evaluator and
observing the results. From the perspective of the user, an input expression
such as <tt>(* x x)</tt> is an expression in the programming language, which the
evaluator should execute. From the perspective of the evaluator, however, the
expression is simply a list (in this case, a list of three symbols: <tt>*</tt>,
<tt>x</tt>, and <tt>x</tt>) that is to be manipulated according to a well-defined
set of rules.

That the user's programs are the evaluator's data need not be a source of
confusion. In fact, it is sometimes convenient to ignore this distinction, and
to give the user the ability to explicitly evaluate a data object as a Lisp
expression, by making <tt>eval</tt> available for use in programs. Many Lisp
dialects provide a primitive <tt>eval</tt> procedure that takes as arguments an
expression and an environment and evaluates the expression relative to the
environment.@footnote{Warning: This <tt>eval</tt> primitive is not identical to
the <tt>eval</tt> procedure we implemented in section <a href="4-1-metacircular.html">4.1.1</a>, because it
uses <em>actual</em> Scheme environments rather than the sample environment
structures we built in section <a href="4-1-metacircular.html">4.1.3</a>. These actual environments cannot
be manipulated by the user as ordinary lists; they must be accessed via
<tt>eval</tt> or other special operations. Similarly, the <tt>apply</tt> primitive
we saw earlier is not identical to the metacircular <tt>apply</tt>, because it
uses actual Scheme procedures rather than the procedure objects we constructed
in sections 4-1-3 and 4-1-4.} Thus,

<div id="scheme-eval-uie">
(eval '(* 5 5) user-initial-environment)
</div>
<script>
C.no_output_frozen_prompt("scheme-eval-uie");
</script>

and

</div>
<script>
C.no_output_frozen_prompt("scheme-eval-uie-2");
</script>


<p> will both return 25.@footnote{The @acronym{MIT} implementation of Scheme
includes <tt>eval</tt>, as well as a symbol <tt>user-initial-environment</tt> that
is bound to the initial environment in which the user's input expressions are
evaluated.}

<div class="exercise">
<p> <b>Exercise 4.15:</b> Given a one-argument procedure

<h3> 4.1.6 Internal Definitions </h3>

<p> Our environment model of evaluation and our metacircular evaluator execute
definitions in sequence, extending the environment frame one definition at a
time. This is particularly convenient for interactive program development, in
which the programmer needs to freely mix the application of procedures with the
definition of new procedures. However, if we think carefully about the
internal definitions used to implement block structure (introduced in section
1-1-8), we will find that name-by-name extension of the environment may
not be the best way to define local variables.

Consider a procedure with internal definitions, such as

<div id="scheme-internal-defs">
(define (f x)
  (define (even? n)
    (if (= n 0)
        true
        (odd? (- n 1))))
  (define (odd? n)
    (if (= n 0)
        false
        (even? (- n 1))))
  ⟨rest of body of f⟩)
</div>
<script>
C.prompt("scheme-internal-defs");
</script>

<p> Our intention here is that the name <tt>odd?</tt> in the body of the procedure
<tt>even?</tt> should refer to the procedure <tt>odd?</tt> that is defined after
<tt>even?</tt>. The scope of the name <tt>odd?</tt> is the entire body of
<tt>f</tt>, not just the portion of the body of <tt>f</tt> starting at the point
where the <tt>define</tt> for <tt>odd?</tt> occurs. Indeed, when we consider that
<tt>odd?</tt> is itself defined in terms of <tt>even?</tt>---so that <tt>even?</tt>
and <tt>odd?</tt> are mutually recursive procedures---we see that the only
satisfactory interpretation of the two <tt>define</tt>s is to regard them as if
the names <tt>even?</tt> and <tt>odd?</tt> were being added to the environment
simultaneously. More generally, in block structure, the scope of a local name
is the entire procedure body in which the <tt>define</tt> is evaluated.

As it happens, our interpreter will evaluate calls to <tt>f</tt> correctly, but
for an ``accidental'' reason: Since the definitions of the internal procedures
come first, no calls to these procedures will be evaluated until all of them
have been defined. Hence, <tt>odd?</tt>  will have been defined by the time
<tt>even?</tt> is executed. In fact, our sequential evaluation mechanism will
give the same result as a mechanism that directly implements simultaneous
definition for any procedure in which the internal definitions come first in a
body and evaluation of the value expressions for the defined variables doesn't
actually use any of the defined variables. (For an example of a procedure that
doesn't obey these restrictions, so that sequential definition isn't equivalent
to simultaneous definition, see Exercise 4-19.)@footnote{Wanting programs
to not depend on this evaluation mechanism is the reason for the ``management
is not responsible'' remark in Footnote 28 of Chapter 1. By
insisting that internal definitions come first and do not use each other while
the definitions are being evaluated, the @acronym{IEEE} standard for Scheme
leaves implementors some choice in the mechanism used to evaluate these
definitions. The choice of one evaluation rule rather than another here may
seem like a small issue, affecting only the interpretation of ``badly formed''
programs. However, we will see in section <a href="5-5-compilation.html">5.5.6</a> that moving to a model
of simultaneous scoping for internal definitions avoids some nasty difficulties
that would otherwise arise in implementing a compiler.}

There is, however, a simple way to treat definitions so that internally defined
names have truly simultaneous scope---just create all local variables that will
be in the current environment before evaluating any of the value expressions.
One way to do this is by a syntax transformation on <tt>lambda</tt> expressions.
Before evaluating the body of a <tt>lambda</tt> expression, we ``scan out'' and
eliminate all the internal definitions in the body. The internally defined
variables will be created with a <tt>let</tt> and then set to their values by
assignment. For example, the procedure

<div id="">
(lambda <vars>
  (define u <e1>)
  (define v <e2>)
  <e3>)
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>


would be transformed into

<div id="">
(lambda <vars>
  (let ((u '*unassigned*)
        (v '*unassigned*))
    (set! u <e1>)
    (set! v <e2>)
    <e3>))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>


where <tt>*unassigned*</tt> is a special symbol that causes looking up a variable
to signal an error if an attempt is made to use the value of the
not-yet-assigned variable.

An alternative strategy for scanning out internal definitions is shown in
Exercise 4-18. Unlike the transformation shown above, this enforces the
restriction that the defined variables' values can be evaluated without using
any of the variables' values.@footnote{The @acronym{IEEE} standard for Scheme
allows for different implementation strategies by specifying that it is up to
the programmer to obey this restriction, not up to the implementation to
enforce it. Some Scheme implementations, including @acronym{MIT} Scheme, use
the transformation shown above. Thus, some programs that don't obey this
restriction will in fact run in such implementations.}

<div class="exercise">
<p> <b>Exercise 4.16:</b> In this exercise we implement the
method just described for interpreting internal definitions. We assume that
the evaluator supports <tt>let</tt> (see Exercise 4-6).

<ul>
<li>

Write a procedure <tt>scan-out-defines</tt> that takes a procedure body and

simultaneous scope rule for internal procedure definitions, and that it is
unreasonable to treat procedure names differently from other names. Thus, she
argues for the mechanism implemented in Exercise 4-16. This would lead
to <tt>a</tt> being unassigned at the time that the value for <tt>b</tt> is to be
computed. Hence, in Alyssa's view the procedure should produce an error. Eva
has a third opinion. She says that if the definitions of <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>
are truly meant to be simultaneous, then the value 5 for <tt>a</tt> should be
used in evaluating <tt>b</tt>. Hence, in Eva's view <tt>a</tt> should be 5,
<tt>b</tt> should be 15, and the result should be 20. Which (if any) of these
viewpoints do you support?  Can you devise a way to implement internal
definitions so that they behave as Eva prefers?@footnote{The @acronym{MIT}
implementors of Scheme support Alyssa on the following grounds: Eva is in
principle correct -- the definitions should be regarded as simultaneous. But
it seems difficult to implement a general, efficient mechanism that does what
Eva requires. In the absence of such a mechanism, it is better to generate an
error in the difficult cases of simultaneous definitions (Alyssa's notion) than
to produce an incorrect answer (as Ben would have it).}

<h3> 4.1.7 Separating Syntactic Analysis from Execution </h3>

<p> The evaluator implemented above is simple, but it is very inefficient, because
the syntactic analysis of expressions is interleaved with their execution.
Thus if a program is executed many times, its syntax is analyzed many times.
Consider, for example, evaluating <tt>(factorial 4)</tt> using the following
definition of <tt>factorial</tt>:

<div id="">
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 1)
      1
      (* (factorial (- n 1)) n)))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> Each time <tt>factorial</tt> is called, the evaluator must determine that the
body is an <tt>if</tt> expression and extract the predicate. Only then can it
evaluate the predicate and dispatch on its value. Each time it evaluates the
expression <tt>(* (factorial (- n 1)) n)</tt>, or the subexpressions
<tt>(factorial (- n 1))</tt> and <tt>(- n 1)</tt>, the evaluator must perform the
case analysis in <tt>eval</tt> to determine that the expression is an
application, and must extract its operator and operands. This analysis is
expensive. Performing it repeatedly is wasteful.

<p> We can transform the evaluator to be significantly more efficient by arranging
things so that syntactic analysis is performed only once.@footnote{This
technique is an integral part of the compilation process, which we shall
discuss in Chapter 5. Jonathan Rees wrote a Scheme interpreter like this
in about 1982 for the T project (Rees and Adams 1982). Marc Feeley (1986) (see
also Feeley and Lapalme 1987) independently invented this technique in his
master's thesis.} We split <tt>eval</tt>, which takes an expression and an
environment, into two parts. The procedure <tt>analyze</tt> takes only the
expression. It performs the syntactic analysis and returns a new procedure,
the <tt>execution procedure</tt>
, that encapsulates the work to be done in
executing the analyzed expression. The execution procedure takes an
environment as its argument and completes the evaluation. This saves work
because <tt>analyze</tt> will be called only once on an expression, while the
execution procedure may be called many times.

<p> With the separation into analysis and execution, <tt>eval</tt> now becomes

<div id="">
(define (eval exp env)
  ((analyze exp) env))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> The result of calling <tt>analyze</tt> is the execution procedure to be applied
to the environment. The <tt>analyze</tt> procedure is the same case analysis as
performed by the original <tt>eval</tt> of section <a href="4-1-metacircular.html">4.1.1</a>, except that the
procedures to which we dispatch perform only analysis, not full evaluation:

<div id="">
(define (analyze exp)
  (cond ((self-evaluating? exp)
         (analyze-self-evaluating exp))
        ((quoted? exp) (analyze-quoted exp))
        ((variable? exp) (analyze-variable exp))
        ((assignment? exp) (analyze-assignment exp))
        ((definition? exp) (analyze-definition exp))
        ((if? exp) (analyze-if exp))
        ((lambda? exp) (analyze-lambda exp))
        ((begin? exp) (analyze-sequence (begin-actions exp)))
        ((cond? exp) (analyze (cond->if exp)))
        ((application? exp) (analyze-application exp))
        (else
         (error "Unknown expression type -- ANALYZE" exp))))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> Here is the simplest syntactic analysis procedure, which handles
self-evaluating expressions. It returns an execution procedure that ignores
its environment argument and just returns the expression:

<div id="">
(define (analyze-self-evaluating exp)
  (lambda (env) exp))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> For a quoted expression, we can gain a little efficiency by extracting the text
of the quotation only once, in the analysis phase, rather than in the execution
phase.

<div id="">
(define (analyze-quoted exp)
  (let ((qval (text-of-quotation exp)))
    (lambda (env) qval)))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> Looking up a variable value must still be done in the execution phase, since
this depends upon knowing the environment.@footnote{There is, however, an
important part of the variable search that <em>can</em> be done as part of the
syntactic analysis. As we will show in section <a href="5-5-compilation.html">5.5.6</a>, one can determine
the position in the environment structure where the value of the variable will
be found, thus obviating the need to scan the environment for the entry that
matches the variable.}

<div id="">
(define (analyze-variable exp)
  (lambda (env) (lookup-variable-value exp env)))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> <tt>Analyze-assignment</tt> also must defer actually setting the variable until
the execution, when the environment has been supplied. However, the fact that
the <tt>assignment-value</tt> expression can be analyzed (recursively) during
analysis is a major gain in efficiency, because the <tt>assignment-value</tt>
expression will now be analyzed only once. The same holds true for
definitions.

<div id="">
(define (analyze-assignment exp)
  (let ((var (assignment-variable exp))
        (vproc (analyze (assignment-value exp))))
    (lambda (env)
      (set-variable-value! var (vproc env) env)
      'ok)))

(define (analyze-definition exp)
  (let ((var (definition-variable exp))
        (vproc (analyze (definition-value exp))))
    (lambda (env)
      (define-variable! var (vproc env) env)
      'ok)))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> For <tt>if</tt> expressions, we extract and analyze the predicate, consequent,
and alternative at analysis time.

<div id="">
(define (analyze-if exp)
  (let ((pproc (analyze (if-predicate exp)))
        (cproc (analyze (if-consequent exp)))
        (aproc (analyze (if-alternative exp))))
    (lambda (env)
      (if (true? (pproc env))
          (cproc env)
          (aproc env)))))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> Analyzing a <tt>lambda</tt> expression also achieves a major gain in efficiency:
We analyze the <tt>lambda</tt> body only once, even though procedures resulting
from evaluation of the <tt>lambda</tt> may be applied many times.

<div id="">
(define (analyze-lambda exp)
  (let ((vars (lambda-parameters exp))
        (bproc (analyze-sequence (lambda-body exp))))
    (lambda (env) (make-procedure vars bproc env))))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> Analysis of a sequence of expressions (as in a <tt>begin</tt> or the body of a
<tt>lambda</tt> expression) is more involved.@footnote{See Exercise 4-23
for some insight into the processing of sequences.} Each expression in the
sequence is analyzed, yielding an execution procedure. These execution
procedures are combined to produce an execution procedure that takes an
environment as argument and sequentially calls each individual execution
procedure with the environment as argument.

<div id="">
(define (analyze-sequence exps)
  (define (sequentially proc1 proc2)
    (lambda (env) (proc1 env) (proc2 env)))
  (define (loop first-proc rest-procs)
    (if (null? rest-procs)
        first-proc
        (loop (sequentially first-proc (car rest-procs))
              (cdr rest-procs))))
  (let ((procs (map analyze exps)))
    (if (null? procs)
        (error "Empty sequence -- ANALYZE"))
    (loop (car procs) (cdr procs))))
</div>
<script>
C.prompt();
</script>

<p> To analyze an application, we analyze the operator and operands and construct
an execution procedure that calls the operator execution procedure (to obtain
the actual procedure to be applied) and the operand execution procedures (to
obtain the actual arguments). We then pass these to
<tt>execute-application</tt>, which is the analog of <tt>apply</tt> in section
4-1-1. <tt>Execute-application</tt> differs from <tt>apply</tt> in that the
procedure body for a compound procedure has already been analyzed, so there is
no need to do further analysis. Instead, we just call the execution procedure
for the body on the extended environment.

<div id="">

<p> Eva Lu Ator explains to Alyssa that the version in the text does more of the
work of evaluating a sequence at analysis time. Alyssa's sequence-execution
procedure, rather than having the calls to the individual execution procedures
built in, loops through the procedures in order to call them: In effect,
although the individual expressions in the sequence have been analyzed, the
sequence itself has not been.

<p> Compare the two versions of <tt>analyze-sequence</tt>. For example, consider the
common case (typical of procedure bodies) where the sequence has just one
expression. What work will the execution procedure produced by Alyssa's
program do?  What about the execution procedure produced by the program in the
text above?  How do the two versions compare for a sequence with two
expressions?

<p><a href="#footnote_link_1-4" class="footnote_backlink">4</a> If we grant ourselves the ability to apply primitives, then what remains for us to implement in the evaluator?  The job of the evaluator is not to specify the primitives of the language, but rather to provide the connective tissue---the means of combination and the means of abstraction---that binds a collection of primitives to form a language. Specifically:

<ul>
<li>
<p> The evaluator enables us to deal with nested expressions. For example, although simply applying primitives would suffice for evaluating the expression <tt>(+ 1 6)</tt>, it is not adequate for handling <tt>(+ 1 (* 2 3))</tt>. As far as the primitive procedure <tt>+</tt> is concerned, its arguments must be numbers, and it would choke if we passed it the expression <tt>(* 2 3)</tt> as an argument. One important role of the evaluator is to choreograph procedure composition so that <tt>(* 2 3)</tt> is reduced to 6 before being passed as an argument to <tt>+</tt>.
</li>

<li>
<p> The evaluator allows us to use variables. For example, the primitive procedure for addition has no way to deal with expressions such as <tt>(+ x 1)</tt>. We need an evaluator to keep track of variables and obtain their values before invoking the primitive procedures.
</li>

<li>
<p> The evaluator allows us to define compound procedures. This involves keeping track of procedure definitions, knowing how to use these definitions in evaluating expressions, and providing a mechanism that enables procedures to accept arguments.
</li>

<li>
<p> The evaluator provides the special forms, which must be evaluated differently
from procedure calls.

We could have simplified the <tt>application?</tt> clause in <tt>eval</tt> by using <tt>map</tt> (and stipulating that <tt>operands</tt> returns a list) rather than writing an explicit <tt>list-of-values</tt> procedure. We chose not to use <tt>map</tt> here to emphasize the fact that the evaluator can be implemented without any use of higher-order procedures (and thus could be written in a language that doesn't have higher-order procedures), even though the language that it supports will include higher-order procedures.

These selectors for a list of expressions---and the corresponding ones for a list of operands---are not intended as a data abstraction.

Practical Lisp systems provide a mechanism that allows a user to add new derived expressions and specify their implementation as syntactic transformations without modifying the evaluator. Such a user-defined transformation is called a <tt>macro</tt> . Although it is easy to add an elementary mechanism for defining macros, the resulting language has subtle name-conflict problems. There has been much research on mechanisms for macro definition that do not cause these difficulties. See, for example, Kohlbecker 1986, Clinger and Rees 1991, and Hanson 1991.

Frames are not really a data abstraction in the following code: <tt>Set-variable-value!</tt> and <tt>define-variable!</tt> use <tt>set-car!</tt>  to directly modify the values in a frame. The purpose of the frame procedures is to make the environment-manipulation procedures easy to read.

The drawback of this representation (as well as the variant in Exercise 4-11) is that the evaluator may have to search through many frames in order to find the binding for a given variable. (Such an approach is referred to as <tt>deep binding</tt> .)  One way to avoid this inefficiency is to make use of a strategy called <tt>lexical addressing</tt>, which will be discussed in section <a href="5-5-compilation.html">5.5.6</a>.

Any procedure defined in the underlying Lisp can be used as a primitive for the metacircular evaluator. The name of a primitive installed in the evaluator need not be the same as the name of its implementation in the underlying Lisp; the names are the same here because the metacircular evaluator implements Scheme itself. Thus, for example, we could put <tt>(list 'first car)</tt> or <tt>(list 'square (lambda (x) (* x x)))</tt> in the list of <tt>primitive-procedures</tt>.

<tt>Apply-in-underlying-scheme</tt> is the <tt>apply</tt> procedure we have used in earlier chapters. The metacircular evaluator's <tt>apply</tt> procedure (section <a href="4-1-metacircular.html">4.1.1</a>) models the working of this primitive. Having two different things called <tt>apply</tt> leads to a technical problem in running the metacircular evaluator, because defining the metacircular evaluator's <tt>apply</tt> will mask the definition of the primitive. One way around this is to rename the metacircular <tt>apply</tt> to avoid conflict with the name of the primitive procedure. We have assumed instead that we have saved a reference to the underlying <tt>apply</tt> by doing

<div id="scheme-apply-in-underlying-scheme">
